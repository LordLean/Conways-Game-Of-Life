# Conways-Game-Of-Life
Python implementation of Conway's game of life. 0-player game where evolution is determined by the population's seed. Animation is handled using Matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation().

Seeds are held in "seeds.py" in dictionary form: seed_collection $\rightarrow$ {\<CLI Key\>: [\<seed name\>, <seed's list of tuples>]}. Add new seeds above the collection and save reference in the seed_collection dictionary with new key and seed name (this is used for the output's title).
